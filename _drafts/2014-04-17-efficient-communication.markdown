title: Thoughts about Efficient Written Communication
categories: life-hacking

This article should probably start with a warning that it is **not** a great example of efficient written communication and instead more of a rambling that may or may not lead to anything coherent at the end.

I send and receive a lot of emails every day at work, and in addition, our entire company communicates via a instant messaging system with each other. The effect of this is that a lot of my daily communication is in writing.

I've noticed that individual people use very different styles. My previous boss always adhered to what I would describe as formal email etiquette. Every email started with "Hi Thomas," and it ended with "Thanks", "Regards", "Cheers", etc and my bosses name. The grammar, spelling and punctuation was always immaculate. The subject line was a well-thought-out summary of the email's content.

My current boss's emails are very different: An entire email could consist of 2 words (one for the subject, one for the content). The text is usually all lower-case. There is no greeting, no sign-off, he uses non-words like "asap", "tmrw", "y" (the last one is short for "yes"). I'd describe his style with maximizing the content/letter ratio.

This had an effect on how I reply to his emails, to a point where I feel bad about wasting letters in my replies. At first, the greeting went away. I suppose he knows that the email is to him, so there's no content lost. sign-off and my name at the end of the email disappeared, too. He sees the sender name anyway. I started going through already written drafts and removing unnecessary filler words, like "maybe", "sometimes", ... I still prefer correct capitalization of words, but upper-case letters don't waste any space so I suppose they can stay. All these little changes increase the content/letter ratio, but there is something else that gets lost in the process: tone. 

Here an example:

    1. "Hi Thomas, can you send me the file we spoke about when you get the chance? Thanks."
    2. "can u send me the file asap".

Sentence 2 saves 67.4% of letters, with (arguably) the same content. But which email would you rather get from your boss? And how much _time_ did he save by writing 2. instead of 1.? Maybe 10 seconds? And do they matter?

Let's say they actually do matter, he is very busy all day long. But where does that leave me? Not only do I still write my first _longish_ email draft, but then I do a second pass through it to remove words again. And since I'm usually aiming for perfection in these things, I probably read the email again two to three times just to get a feeling how it may be received (does anyone else do that?). So in the end, it actually takes me a lot longer to complete the short email. One could argue that my time is more expendable than that of my boss, so there may be value in doing this, after all. But I also feel like the tone that gets lost in this act of letter reduction is important, too. 

Let's look at this 3rd version of the example sentence from above: 

    3. "Thomas, I really need this file as soon as possible. Can you send it to me straight away?"

Both sentences, 1. and 3., would probably reduce to number 2. But there is so much sub-text in those sentences. The first one is a "friendly reminder" to send the file. It also has a note of curiosity as if it said "I was really interested in the file you mentioned and would like to read more." Sentence 3. has much higher urgency, and a more accusatory tone ("I already told you I need the file and you still haven't given it to me.") All this sub-conscious information gets lost in the process of compressing the sentence down to the bare content.
